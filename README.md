This is the sample code of a discord event manager bot,
that I made a while ago. So the project is no longer updated...

## General Info
* It is single server only but it can be easily modified.
*  I'm frensh so every responses messages are not translated.
* This is a sample code, so you need to create your own app and
  replace the "TOKEN" variable in "main.py"
* You can also change the "PREFIX" variable.

## Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version: 3.6
* [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) python library version: 1.5.0
* [Pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) python library version: 2018.3

## Setup
* Download zip, fork or clone.
* Install requirements
* Replace the "TOKEN" to your app one.
* Got to "engine/settings.py", Change IDs:
(ANIMATEURID: ID of the role with permissions to manage events,
EVENTPLAYERID: ID of the role that will be given to players,
EVENTSCHANNELID: ID of the default event announcement channel)
* Change the "TIME_ZONE"
* Translate every messages if you are not frensh...
